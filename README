# Go Fish ðŸŽ£

**Go Fish** is a phishing simulation and awareness tool designed for security heads of companies to educate employees on how to avoid phishing attacks. The tool allows administrators to send phishing emails to employees and track whether they click on potentially dangerous links. If they do, they are safely redirected to educational resources about phishing prevention, helping them understand the risks and how to protect themselves in the future.

## Overview

Phishing is a growing threat in the digital age, especially with the increasing reliance on email and other communication tools. **Go Fish** helps companies run internal phishing simulations to assess and improve employee awareness of phishing attacks. The tool lets administrators:

- Add employees/contacts.
- Send phishing emails to selected contacts.
- Track how many employees clicked on the phishing link.
- Redirect users who clicked on the link to a learning page with government-approved resources to avoid future phishing attacks.

This project aims to provide a safe, educational experience for employees and valuable insights for administrators.

## Features

- **Admin Interface**: Allows admins to manage contacts, send phishing emails, and monitor results.
- **Email Tracking**: Tracks whether employees have opened the phishing email and clicked the malicious link.
- **Phishing Statistics**: Provides visual statistics (pie charts, bar charts) to show which contacts clicked the link and which did not.
- **Educational Redirect**: After clicking the phishing link, employees are taken to an educational page with resources to learn about the risks of phishing.
- **Department and Role Segmentation**: Statistics can be filtered by employee department and role for better analysis.
